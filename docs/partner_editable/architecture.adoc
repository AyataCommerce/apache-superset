As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed internet gateway for inbound traffic to an Application Load Balancer.
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to provide outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** An Application Load Balancer that manages the traffic to the Fargate cluster.
*In the private subnets:
** An Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) cluster using Fargate, to provide all Superset functions, including the core system, cache, database, message queue, and frontend.
** An Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) to provide metadata, query cache data persistency, and share service modules.
** AWS Cloud Map used as discovery service for application resources.
* Amazon Athena a serverless, interactive query service to query data and analyze big data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL.
* Amazon RedShift a fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service in the cloud.
** A MySQL instance, which is included with ClickHouse.
** A Postgres instance, which is included with ClickHouse.
